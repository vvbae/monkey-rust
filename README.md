## Notes

This repository is forked from [Monkey-Rust](https://github.com/Rydgel/monkey-rust). The original repository stores the Rust version of [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/#the-monkey-programming-language) by the same author. This repository borrows the codes of [parser/](https://github.com/Rydgel/monkey-rust/tree/master/lib/parser) and [lexer/](https://github.com/Rydgel/monkey-rust/tree/master/lib/lexer) of the mentioned repository, which I used as part of my implementation of the Rust version of the compiler. 

## Whatâ€™s Monkey?

Monkey has a C-like syntax, supports **variable bindings**, **prefix** and **infix operators**, has **first-class** and **higher-order functions**, can handle **closures** with ease and has **integers**, **booleans**, **arrays** and **hashes** built-in.

There is a book about learning how to make a compiler: [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/#the-monkey-programming-language). This is where the Monkey programming language come from.
